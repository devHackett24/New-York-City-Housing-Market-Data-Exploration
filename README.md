# New York City Housing Market Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze data from the New York City housing market to uncover meaningful insights and trends. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploration of key areas of interest, and visualization of the findings using Tableau.

## Project Workflow

### Data Cleaning

The first step in the analysis was to clean the raw data. This involved:

- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Extracting relevant features such as postal codes from addresses

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Several areas of interest were explored during the EDA phase:

1. **Most Prominent Brokers in Each Borough**
   - Identified the most active brokers by the number of properties listed in each borough (sublocality).

2. **Density of Properties Per Borough**
   - Analyzed the distribution and density of properties across the five boroughs to understand where the highest concentrations of properties are located.

3. **Foreclosures in Each Borough**
   - Examined foreclosure rates in different boroughs to determine areas with higher incidences of foreclosed properties.

4. **Comparison of Housing Costs and Sizes**
   - Compared the average cost and size of different types of housing (house, condo, condop, flat, multi-family home) across each borough to identify pricing trends and size variations.

### Data Visualization

To effectively communicate the insights gained from the analysis, a comprehensive dashboard was created using Tableau. The dashboard includes:

- **Bar Charts**: Showing the most prominent brokers and comparing housing rates across different boroughs and property types.
- **Map**: Displaying the distribution and density of properties in the NYC area.
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrating the proportions of foreclosures in the different boroughs.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the New York City housing market provided valuable insights into the roles of brokers, property distributions, and the economic landscape of housing across different boroughs. The Tableau dashboard offers a clear and interactive way to visualize these findings, making it easier to understand and communicate the trends identified in the data.
